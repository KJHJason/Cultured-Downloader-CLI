# Contributing Guidelines

- If you would like to make a pull request, please keep your code simple for me to understand it. I am still a student learning programming so if I'm unable to understand what's your code doing, I will be unable to maintain it.

- Please do not just change the syntax just for the purpose of "best practices". Unless it makes a difference such as in performance, etc. 

- Ensure that your updated code **runs**.
